# [To-do List App](https://aplambeck-js-todolist.netlify.app/)

### Overview:
- A to-do list web app that allows the user to add new to-do items, check off to-dos, and delete to-dos.
- I added a sorting feature, organizing the to-dos by "Completed" & "Incomplete."
- In addition, the to-dos save to local storage, allowing the user to pick up where they left off even after closing the web app.
